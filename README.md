# Inline-SVGs-uploaded-to-Elementor-Icon-Widget
Inlines any SVG file directly into the root HTML document when the SVG is inserted via an Elementor icon widget, eliminating the HTTP request for the SVG file which can improve and minimize the performance of small SVG files. This functionality is toggleable from the Elementor advanced settings panel for icon widgets on a per widget basis.
